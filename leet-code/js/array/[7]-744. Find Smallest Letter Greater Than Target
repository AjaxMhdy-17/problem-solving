problem : 744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target :

Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order
and a character target, return the smallest character
in the array that is larger than target.

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
Output: "c"

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"
Output: "f"

Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "j"
Output: "c"

//solution


var letters = ["c","f","j"] 
var target = "j"

var nextGreatestLetter = function(letters, target) {
    let r = (target.charCodeAt(0))
    // r += 1 
    // console.log(r)
    for( let i = 0 ; i < letters.length ; i++ ){
        const v = letters[i].charCodeAt(0)
        if(v > r){
            let w = String.fromCharCode(v)
            return w 
        }
    }
    return letters[0] 
};
var r = nextGreatestLetter(letters , target)
console.log(r)
