problem : 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations


There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:

++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.

Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, 
return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

Input: operations = ["--X","X++","X++"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X =  0 - 1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = -1 + 1 =  0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X =  0 + 1 =  1.


//solution

var x = ["--X","X++","X++"]

var finalValueAfterOperations = function(operations) {
    var v = 0 ;
    for( let i = 0 ; i < operations.length ; i++ ){
        if(operations[i] === "--X" || operations[i] === "X--"){
            v = v - 1  
        }
        else{
            v = v + 1 
        }
    }
    return (v)
};
var r = finalValueAfterOperations(x)
