problem : 151. Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. 
The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"

var x = "the sky is blue"

var reverseWords = function(s) {
    s = s.trim() 
    var sr = ''
    for( let i = 0 ; i < s.length  ; i++ ){
        if( s[i] == ' ' && s[i+1] == ' '){
            continue ;
        }
        sr += s[i]
    }

    var vx = '' ;
    sr = ' ' + sr
    var finalStr = ''
    for( let i = sr.length - 1 ; i >= 0  ; i-- ){
        // console.log(sr[i])
        if( sr[i] == ' '){
            finalStr += vx.toString().split('').reverse().join('')
            finalStr += ' '
            vx = ''
        }
        else{
            vx = vx + sr[i]
        }
    }

    return (finalStr.trim())

};

var r = reverseWords(x)
// console.log(r)
